Summary
I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Google. I work
towards understanding User Generated Content (UGC) on Maps,
moderating it, and keeping abusive content away from Google Maps.

Prior to this I worked as a Manager in the Institutional Securities

I have worked on languages and technologies ranging from Java

various Database technologies.

Apart from being an enthusiastic technical developer, I am
also a passionate Toastmaster and have achieved Competent
Communicator and Competent Leader awards so far in the
Toastmasters' journey. I am actively involved in various Technical
Club and Financial Club activities at Morgan Stanley and am part of
the team running the Agile initiative within the firm.

An engineer by profession, a toastmaster by passion, and a learning
enthusiast, I am always keen on accepting new challenges and
solving innovative problems. I am equally fond of travelling, reading,
and engaging in healthy discussions.

Summary
I believe that, when people are learning, they are growing. I’m on a
quest to make excellence a part of those lives that I come in contact
with. For me, every day is an opportunity to make the world that I live
and work in a better, more creative and more compassionate place.

I’m a lifelong optimist who believes that no mountain is too high to
climb, every obstacle has a solution attached to it and even the most
far-reaching dreams can be realised with imagination, creativity and
resilience. My passion is to help the people I come in contact with
turn a great idea into a breakthrough experience that can be seen,
touched and felt globally.

I see that obstacles are just opportunities in disguise. Always looking
over the next horizon, I am constantly seeking a chance to be a part
of that one innovation that can change the way people experience
the world. 

For nearly 30 years, on four continents, I have helped organisations
of all types and sizes learn the art of leadership, influence and
technology disruption. My clients learn how to utilise entrepreneurial
vision, creative thinking and innovation strategies to become experts
in digital, sales, marketing, and brand loyalty. From new startups
to big brands, I have helped teams get smarter while the business
grows.

Before joining the global consulting ranks with IBM, CSC, Creata
and Fujitsu, I was a graphic artist, animator and creative director-
all skills that have served me well as I developed my consulting
skills.  At Trinity Consulting Services, I have been an expert in the
commercialisation of new ideas and the global growth of existing
businesses in APAC, Europe/EMEA and Australia.

PREPARATION SECRETS  -My Channel
According to me, the age of around 16-25 is the most productive phase of our
lives. So, I like to create videos to support students in this phase. 

I believe in the fact that “If you are not WINNING, you are LOSING” . 
So, have a clear picture of your ultimate goal; Each & everyday start taking
baby steps towards your goal. Leave your comfort zone and take calculated
risks, if you want better returns, from your life. 

I also provide One-One Mentorship to students who are aspiring for bright
future, but might not be clear with a specific path.

An engineer from IIT turned Gladrags model. A marketing
professional with a YouTube channel as a hobby. Currently, pursuing
MBA at IIM Bangalore. I also enjoy modelling in print shoots, ads
or short films. Coming from a small town to where I am today, the
experiences have given me a driving force which I work towards -
women empowerment by being an active member of ‘Lean In’ group
by Sheryl Sandberg and bringing the youth of our nation forward
in the big movements for the betterment of society with the help of
‘Nation First’.

I have 2.5 years experience in marketing and content production in
different industries which has given me a scope to understand the
importance of different marketing strategies with different audience.
I have been always lucky to be in touch with technical aspect of
the marketing channels including the pre and post analysis of the
content on different digital platforms including social media through
Google Adwords, Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, Vidooly
etc. 

Content marketing has always been an integral part of my
digital marketing strategies as it helps in good SEO rankings
and user engagement , through the use of prompt and positive
communication, visual design, content strategies, apt image and
presence in social media platforms, market research and making an
effort to cater to the target audience's needs.
