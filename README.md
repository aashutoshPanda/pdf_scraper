# pdf-scraper

pdf-scraper is an open source API for :
- extracting text from PDFs
- extracting filtered-text from LinkedIn resumes


## Demo

You can try the [demo](http://ashutoshpanda01.pythonanywhere.com/).
### Installation(Ubuntu)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashutoshPanda/pdf_scraper.git
apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev antiword unrtf poppler-utils pstotext tesseract-ocr
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app/main.py
```

## Tasks

Code for each task is present in seperate folders
Task 4 is the repo itself.

##### Task 1
- Downloaded 50 LinkedIn resumes and added to task_1 folder.
- Screenshot of 50 files is present in task_1 folder to reduce space

##### Task 2
- Used 'textract' library to get text from all the pdfs
- pdf_to_text.csv is generated by running the main.py script present in task_2 folder

Instructions to run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashutoshPanda/pdf_scraper.git
apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev antiword unrtf poppler-utils pstotext tesseract-ocr
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make folder named 'profile_pdfs' in task_2 folder and add the PDFs in it
python3 task_2/main.py
```

##### Task 3
- For Removing stop-words from a given text NLTK's stop-word list 
(Stop Words: A stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query)
- Some words which are not present in the NLTK's stop-word list but occure frequently in the resumes have to be added to our stop-word list 
- So by calucalating the count of unique words across 50 PDF's we can add the words which are present in 85% of the resumes to our new stop-word list
- Then for each word present in  the given text we can check whether it is present in our updated stop-word-list or not 
- If it is present then it is to be removed

Instructions to run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashutoshPanda/pdf_scraper.git
apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev antiword unrtf poppler-utils pstotext tesseract-ocr
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make folder named 'profile_pdfs' in task_3 folder and add the PDFs in it
python3 task_3/main.py
```


##### Task 4
- Using our functions from Task 2 & Task 3 we can make the required API
- Running the flask app we are presented with two forms to get
		text from PDFs
		filtered text from linkedIn resumes (PDF)
- The routes namely 'text' & 'text_without_stopwords' perform these tasks
- The API is hosted at pythonanywhere at [pdf-scraper](http://http://ashutoshpanda01.pythonanywhere.com/ "pdf-scraper")
